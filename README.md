# Coding for Reproducible Research Workshop Template

This repository is the template for creating websites for workshops that are part of the Coding for Reproducible Research intiative at UoE.  

## How to create a workshop page

To create a new website for a new workshop,  please use GitHub's "template" function to copy this `UoE-workshop-template` repository.
**Please _do not fork this repository directly on GitHub._**

## Structure and required components

Each workshop has a landing or home page which provides the details of the workshop to individuals who might be interested in attending it. This home page will also direct participants who have signed up to set-up instructions and the course notes. It will also enable individuals who can't attend the workshop to all the resources and enable them to run through the material in their own time. 

Workshops are organised into 2-3 hour sessions of learning activity, where a workshop consists of 1-4 sessions. Beginners courses should have a minimum of 2 sessions.  Each session will be split into episodes, where episodes should last between 20-90 mins. Workshops and sessions will follow a prespecified format. We recommend that there is an oppotunity for a break approximately every 60-90 mins. 


## Acknowledgements

This template was developed with help from this [tutorial](https://github.com/evanwill/go-go-ghpages). It was inspired and influenced by  [The Carpentries' template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template) for creating websites for workshops.
