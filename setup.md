## Introduction

For this course, attendees will need to install the programming language Python, and an editor, where we can type commands, and run our programs. We will also need an up-to-date web browser: we recommend a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

Python, and also various editors, are included in the all-in-one installer called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). This makes it easy to install Python and various scientific add-ons, without having to know too much about programming before starting out.

The Software Carpentries have created some excellent guides for installing Anaconda. [These can be found here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python), along with video tutorials for each operating system. Please follow the relevant installation guide for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).

Further installation instructions can be found on the Anaconda web-pages [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation). These are a bit more in-depth!

## Help!

Please have a go at installing Anaconda yourself. If you are struggling, we will be holding an online drop-in on the Monday before the first session. An email link will be made available to you once your registration on the course has been confirmed.
