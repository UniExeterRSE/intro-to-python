## Welcome

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by the Research Software Engineering Group, and supported by a team of volunteers. It has been adapted from the [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) course, by the Software Carpentries. It forms part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for staff and students to expand their skillsets, and position themselves to confidently perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We are grateful for your feedback, a core component of this process.

We will start by introducing the workshop leaders and helpers. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of you, our colleagues. For some of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.

We will have a collaborative document where we can post resources and answer any questions. You are welcome to introduce yourselves at the top of this document.


## Housekeeping

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the workshop schedule available on the course website. Our aim is to have an official break every 60-90 minutes, but there will also be periods in between demonstrations where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required. This workshop will be delivered via live coding, and presentation of course material.

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention. In order to try to provide equality for virtual and in person participants we request that the Teams/Zoom chat is used minimally and all questions/comments etc are posted in our collaborative notes document. This will be saved and distributed to attendees at the end of each workshop session.


## Code of conduct

This course will be delivered in adherence to the teaching principles and guidelines of the University of Exeter. We encourage all attendees to adhere to the code of conduct, which can be found [here](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-python/code.html).

Let's get started.
