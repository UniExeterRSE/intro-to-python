# Next steps
## Thanks you for attending these two session

We hope you have enjoyed this course, and are inspired to start using Python for your research tasks. 

We would be grateful for your feedback. Please send this to Eilis Hannon, at <E.J.hannon@exeter.ac.uk>.

## What next?

Programming is a practical art.  You will learn more by creating programs than from reading books and watching videos.

However, we have provided a list of useful resources on the course website
