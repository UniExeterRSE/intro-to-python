# Wrap-up

## Thanks for coming along!

We hope you have enjoyed this course, and are inspired to start using Python for your research tasks. Please feel free to go through the course notes at your own pace, and complete the exercises that we have provided.

We would be grateful for your feedback. Please send this to Eilis Hannon, at <E.J.hannon@exeter.ac.uk>.

## What next?

The hard part is to choose what to learn next. The best thing you can do is to start using Python, and use it as much as possible, for as many different types of task as you can. At this stage in your journey, gathering broad knowledge will be more beneficial than specialising. However, we have provided a list of resources to check out next [here](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-python/resources.html), which cover many bases.
