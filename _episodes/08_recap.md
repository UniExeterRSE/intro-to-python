## A quick recap:

- Fundamentals
- Data structures: lists and dictionaries
- Control flow: if, elif & else
- Loops
- Exercise: check your understanding

## Fundamentals

We can instantiate variables, and assign data values to them. Lets create some data for the greatest car in the world, the Citroen Berlingo Mk1.

[<img src="../fig/berlingo.jpg" width="600"/>](../fig/berlingo.jpg)

~~~
make = "Citroen"
model = "Berlingo"
color = "blue"
owner = "Simon"
sliding_doors = 2
other_doors = 3
coolness_pc = 95
print(f"My {make} {model} is {coolness_pc}% cool.")
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
My Citroen Berlingo is 95% cool.
~~~
{: .output}

Each variable has a type. We did not have to declare this specifically: Python worked this out based on our data. Some common data types are `string`, `float`, and `int`. We can check the type of a variable using the built-in function, `type`:

~~~
print(type(owner))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
<class 'str'>
~~~
{: .output}

We can write comments using the `#` symbol, or using triple quotes. Lines in these sections will not be executed. An example if shown with the `#` symbol:

~~~
# new_car_make = "Mercedes"
print(new_car_make)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'new_car_make' is not defined
~~~
{: .output}


## Lists and dictionaries

We can hold more than one piece of data in a data structure. We can use create lists using square brackets, as follows:

~~~
car_info = [make, model, color, sliding_doors, other_doors]
print(car_info)
print(type(car_info))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
['Citroen', 'Berlingo', 'blue', 2, 3]
<class 'list'>
~~~
{: .output}

We can access specific elements of a list using the elements index. Remember that indexing starts from 0.

~~~
element_2 = car_info[1]
print(element_2)
print(type(element_2))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Berlingo
<class 'str'>
~~~
{: .output}

Data structures often have built-in functions, or methods, attached to them. These provide fast ways of achieving common tasks. We can use the .append method to insert an element at the final index plus one, of a list:

~~~
cost = 2000
car_info.append(cost)
print(car_info)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
['Citroen', 'Berlingo', 'blue', 2, 3, 2000]
~~~
{: .output}

We can update a list element, using the element's index. Remember that a negative index counts from the end of the list, with an index of -1 indicating the final element index.

~~~
new_cost = 1850
car_info[-1] = new_cost
print(car_info)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
['Citroen', 'Berlingo', 'blue', 2, 3, 1850]
~~~
{: .output}

We can make a dictionary using key, values pairs. Dictionaries are useful when we want to return values, based on a value name, and not an index. For example:

~~~
car_info = {
    "make": "Citroen", 
    "model": "Berlingo", 
    "color": "blue", 
    "owner": "Simon", 
    "sliding_doors": 2, 
    "other_doors": 3, 
    "coolness_pc": 95
}
print(car_info)
print(type(car_info))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
{'make': 'Citroen', 'model': 'Berlingo', 'color': 'blue', 'owner': 'Simon', 'sliding_doors': 2, 'other_doors': 3, 'coolness_pc': 95}
<class 'dict'>
~~~
{: .output}

We can then access values based on their key. To access the value associated with the coolness percentage key:

~~~
print(car_info["coolness_pc"])
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
95
~~~
{: .output}

We can add data to a dictionary in-place, as it is mutable.

~~~
car_info = {
    "make": "Citroen", 
    "model": "Berlingo", 
    "color": "blue", 
    "owner": "Simon", 
    "sliding_doors": 2, 
    "other_doors": 3, 
    "coolness_pc": 95
}
current_price = 1850
car_info["current_price"] = current_price
print(car_info)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
{'make': 'Citroen', 'model': 'Berlingo', 'color': 'blue', 'owner': 'Simon', 'sliding_doors': 2, 'other_doors': 3, 'coolness_pc': 95, 'current_price': 1850}
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, we can access just the keys, just the values, or the key, value pairs of a dictionary, using built-in methods:

~~~
car_fields = list(car_info.keys())
print(car_fields)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
['make', 'model', 'color', 'owner', 'sliding_doors', 'other_doors', 'coolness_pc', 'current_price']
~~~
{: .output}

## Control flow

We can use `if`, `elif` and `else` statements to perform different tasks, based on data values. For example, imagine if we are trying to sell our car, stored in the car_info dictionary. Lets say that we will indicate on our inventory system when a buyer has offered more than 90% of the asking price of a car. We will update the boolean flag when we should sell it.

~~~
sell_flag = False
asking_price = 1500

current_price = car_info["current_price"]

if asking_price >= current_price * 0.9:
    sell_flag = True
    print("You got yourself a deal!")
else:
    print("You're taking the mick matey!")
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
You're taking the mick matey!
~~~
{: .output}

Now for an unrealistic example. Lets say a buyer wants a car that is a Berlingo, but has a car to trade in. As a dealer, we are willing to take the car and a lower asking price for the Berlingo if the car is in our desired car list. We can update our system accordingly, using the `and` and `in` operators.

~~~
sell_flag = False
desired_cars = ["Audi", "Mercedes", "Aston Martin"]

asking_price = 556
trade_in_car = "Audi"

current_price = car_info["current_price"]

if asking_price >= current_price * 0.9:
    sell_flag = True
    print("I'm happy with that.")
elif (trade_in_car in desired_cars) and (asking_price >= current_price * 0.3):
    sell_flag = True
    print("Great to do business with you!")
else:
    print("Sorry mate thats the best I can do.")
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Great to do business with you!
~~~
{: .output}

## Loops

It is often very helpful to perform calculations over a number of items, usually stored in a data structure. If the data structure is iterable, then we can write a `for` loop to execute operations over each element. For example, lets print out every value in our `car_info` dictionary:

~~~
for value in car_info.values():
    print(value)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Citroen
Berlingo
blue
Simon
2
3
95
1850
~~~
{: .output}

Lets try to multiply every value by 10. Why are some results strange?

~~~
for value in car_info.values():
    new_value = value * 10
    print(new_value)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~

~~~

(When we use an asterisk operator on a string we are overloading it. It is actually concatenating the string 10 times!)

## Exercise

> This is a famous (and now overused) programming task used in interviews.
> 
> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50. But for multiples of
> three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
> “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
> “FizzBuzz”."
> 
> Give it a go!

> > ## Hint 1
> > In Python, the modulo operator is `%`. This returns the remainder when 
> > dividing one number by another.
> > ~~~
> > print(10 % 5)
