## Welcome

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by the Research Software Engineering Group supported by a team of volunteers. It has been adpated/influenced by XXX. This is as part of an ongoing initiative to provide training for staff and students to expand their skillsets and position themselves to confidently perform the informatics elements of their research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. The programme and workshops are under constant evoltuion, and we are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. 

We will start by introducing the workshop leaders and helpers. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our collegues. For some of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time. 

We will have a collaborative document where we can post resources and answer Qs. You are welcome to introduce yourselfs at the top of that document. 

## Housekeeping

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the workshop schedule available on the course website. Our aim is to have an official break every 60-90 mintues, but there will also be periods inbetween deomstrations where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required.  This workshop will be delivered by the following methods... <live coding> <demonstrations and exercises>. Inclusion of interactive quizes?
  

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention. In order to try to provide equality for virtual and in person participants we request that the Teams/Zoom chat is used minimally and all questions/comments etc are posted in our collaborative notes document. This will be saved and distributed at the end of the workshop.  

 Highlight the code of conduct - essentially be respectful and aware that we all have different backgrounds, xperiences and viewpoints.
  
  Let's get started.
