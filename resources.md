## Links to additional material

There is a huge amount of amazing resources out there! From full-blown courses, to YouTube creators, from online workshops, to much, much more. We have aggregated a few resources here that you can explore at your leisure.

The best way to learn is by doing! Reading the resources below is a great start, but to really learn how to program,
you have to start trying things out, and creating projects. For example, you could start by re-creating an existing piece of data analysis that you have previously completed in an Excel workbook, graphs and all. Maybe create a simple website to display your photos. This is how we all started.

## Great Python websites

- [Real Python Tutorials](https://realpython.com/)
- [PythonProgramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/)
- [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

## Research Software Engineering

- Our RSE friends at UCL have a great [RSE-focused Python course](http://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/rsd-engineeringcourse/)
- Similarly, those at the the Alan Turing Institute have a [similar one here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rse-course/html/index.html)
- Not just Python focused, The Turing Way is a fantastic guide to [creating reproducible research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research.html)

## Specialised topics

These might be a bit more complex!

- [Web Development in Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/web-development.html)
