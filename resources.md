## Links to additional material

There is a huge amount of amazing resources out there! From full-blown courses, to YouTube creators, from online workshops, to much, much more. We have aggregated a few resources here that you can explore at your leisure.

The best way to learn is by doing! Reading the resources below is a great start, but to really learn how to program,
you have to start trying things out, and creating projects. For example, you could start by re-creating an existing piece of data analysis that you have previously completed in an Excel workbook, graphs and all. Maybe create a simple website to display your photos. This is how we all started.
